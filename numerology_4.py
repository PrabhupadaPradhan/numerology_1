They make good parents and ultimately become the person everyone comes to in the family when things are not going well. They are often insecure and worry about being widowed and left on their own.\n\n66\nThey are inclined to worry unnecessarily about their home and family.

Stress and worry can be a problem for these people.\n\n6666\nThey are highly creative, but they find it hard to channel this energy in the early part of their life. Everything affects them emotionally, which makes it hard for them to fit in to everyday life.\n\n7\nThey are likely to learn through losses of love, possessions or health.

They will be almost entirely without an ego.

f = '1\nPeople with a life path number of 1 have to learn to stand on their own two feet and achieve something. They usually start out in life by being dependent and gradually achieve a degree of independence as they mature. Ultimately, they often become pioneers, innovators and leaders. Ones can be self-centered and like to be at the head of the line. Consequently, they are ambitious, progressive, determined and stubborn. They have inquiring minds and considerable leadership qualities. They have executive skills and can rise through the ranks to the ultimate top position in their field. They have strong personal needs that need to be met. Although this may be disguised to others, people on a 1 life path are aware of it themselves. Whatever their needs are, ones makes sure that they are met. There is a negative side to the 1 life path. Some ones find it hard to achieve independence and seem overly dependent. Consequently, they will be taken advantage of by others and will deeply resent it, even though they feel powerless to prevent it. Another negative side to this 1 life path is that people on it try to build themselves up by pulling others down. They have ego problems and think of themselves first, second and always.\n\n2\nPeople with a life path number of 2 are able to make people feel at ease. They are gracious and charming and make wonderful hosts and hostesses. They are sensitive to the needs of others and find it easy to make friends. They prefer being in a permanent relationship to being on their own. They are sensitive, peace loving and naturally intuitive. They make good friends and express their feelings well. They are not overly concerned with status or material needs. Consequently, they often find themselves in the number two position, rather than the "number one." They are content to be the power behind the throne. In this position they do not always receive the full recognition that they should, but they are usually content knowing that they have done a good job. Occasionally you will find people who are using their 2 life path negatively. They will try desperately to become leaders, preferring to be mediocre in this role instead of outstanding in the number two position. Although they may achieve these aims, they will never feel comfortable or happy in the leadership role.\n\n3\nPeople with a life path number of 3 need to express themselves in some sort of way, ideally creatively. As this expression usually uses verbal skills, it can include singing, talking or writing. Threes are usually excellent conversationalists and enjoy expressing all the joys of life. Communication is their forte. They have active, imaginative brains and are always full of ideas. However, they often lack the motivation to put them into play. People on this life path are friendly, sociable and outgoing. They enjoy having others around them and cannot stand being on their own for very long. Their path is lighthearted and less serious than other paths. Some people with a 3 life path use it negatively by being superficial and scatterbrained. They dabble in numerous areas but never take anything very far. This lack of purpose distresses people close to them, particularly when they start overindulging in alcohol, drugs and/or sex.\n\n4\nPeople with a life path number of 4 need to work hard to achieve their goals. They are practical, reliable, conscientious and well-organized people who enjoy keeping to routines. They are able to create order out of chaos. They are hard workers who enjoy seeing the results of their labour. Fours are prepared to patiently plod along for years, provided they can see that the effort is worthwhile. They are good with details and enjoy fine, complicated tasks. Inclined to being rigid and stubborn, they find it very hard to change their minds once it has been made up. They have strong likes and dislikes and are not afraid to express their views. There are many people who use their 4 life path negatively. These people dislike their feelings of limitation and restriction and try to fight them by becoming dominating and abusive. Their inability to see the larger picture costs them opportunities which results in increasing frustration.\n\n5\nPeople with a life path number of 5 are versatile and enjoy doing a wide variety of different things. They become restless and impatient when they feel restricted in any way. They enjoy travel, excitement and anything that takes them out of their familiar routines. Fives are quick thinkers who enjoy solving problems. Early on in life they are inclined to dabble, but once they find their correct path, they frequently achieve a great deal. These people are always curious, enthusiastic and forever young at heart. The negative side of a 5 life path is overindulgence. These people often change directions and find it impossible to stick to anything for long. Many experiment with and overindulge in alcohol, drugs, and sex.\n\n6\nPeople with a life path number of 6 are nurturing, caring and responsible. They enjoy accepting other people\'s burdens and providing a shoulder for others to lean on. They particularly enjoy helping the people they care for. They become the members of the family that the others turn to when things are not going well. Sixes are capable of solving problems between others in such a way that everyone feels happy with the outcome. Sympathetic, loving and kind, they are happiest when surrounded by their friends and loved ones. Sixes are often creative, usually in artistic fields. It is rare to find people using their 6 life path negatively. However, sixes who accept everyone\'s responsibilities often end up being overwhelmed by everyone else\'s problems.\n\n7\nPeople with a life path number of 7 need time by themselves to grow in knowledge and wisdom. They have their own special, unique approach to everything they do. This gives them great originality, but also means that they find it hard to make changes and adapt. It also can sometimes make it difficult for them to feel comfortable as part of a group. Sevens prefer a few close friends to large groups of acquaintances. They can be hard to get to know initially as they protect themselves with barriers, but they make good friends once they fully trust the other person. Reserved, cautious and introspective, sevens are spiritual people and their philosophy of life grows and develops as they go through life. People on the negative side of their 7 life path find it impossible to get close to others and hide themselves away. They become increasingly introspective and self-centered.\n\n8\nPeople with a life path number of 8 enjoy being involved in largescale enterprises and want to reap the rewards of their success. They set worthwhile goals for themselves, then go out and achieve these goals. They are ambitious and determined and invariably achieve their aims. Eights live very much in the real world and have no time for dreamers. They are good at dealing with money and once they achieve their financial goals they can be very generous. They are good judges of character. They have leadership capabilities and usually rise to positions of responsibility. Eights are inclined to be rigid and stubborn in outlook, though usually they cannot see this trait in themselves. People who use their 8 life path negatively achieve large sums of money, but do so at the cost of health, happiness and relationships. They can become intolerant, vengeful, and powerhungry.\n\n9\nPeople with a life path number of 9 are inclined to be self-sacrificing, sensitive, caring people with a strong need to serve others, they enjoy helping others and frequently give much more than they receive in return. Consequently, they can easily be taken advantage of by others. Nines are romantics at heart and are profoundly disappointed when their deep, true love is not returned. These humanitarian aims of the nine are usually slightly detached and universal in scope. Nine is the third creative number and these people often express their creativity in writing, though it can come out in many different ways. You will find many negative people on a 9 life path. This is because it is so difficult to remain selfless and giving in a materialistic world. These people try taking instead of giving. They never find any satisfaction in this, as they are fighting their true nature.\n\n11\nPeople with a life path number of 11 are idealistic. They are frequently visionaries, they have access to unique ideas and are dreamers rather than doers. However, they are extremely capable at whatever they do and with sufficient motivation, can achieve anything. Because their ideas are not always practical, they need to evaluate them carefully before attempting to pursue them. Elevens are always intuitive and caring. People who use the negative side of their 11 life path are impractical dreamers who achieve little and live in a world where it is hard to separate reality from fantasy.\n\n22\nPeople with a life path number of 22 are able to achieve anything they set their minds on. Usually, their goal is something large in scope. They have a great deal of ability and need to channel it constructively. Elevens are often dreamers; twenty-twos also have the dreams, but then make them happen. These people are practical, usually unconventional and frequently charismatic. They are able to excite and motivate others with their words and actions. The negative side of a 22 life path is selfishness. Twenty-twos use their considerable abilities for their own ends and totally ignore the needs of others. Sometimes they are aware of this trait, but find it difficult to move onto a more positive track.'

f = 'Determination\nIt makes people born with it determined and persistent. They are patient and prepared to wait for whatever it is they have set their minds on. However, it is not always easy to be patient for long periods of time and these people need to learn to control their temper. This is particularly the case if the number 4 is missing from their chart.\n\nCompassion\nPeople with this combination develop a strong faith and philosophy of life. This is normally caused by life\'s experiences; consequently these people often lead sad lives. However, as they mature, they develop an inner serenity and a strong faith that sustains and comforts them. Many people with this arrow have a strong interest in music.\n\nIntellect\nPeople who possess this arrow have a good mind and an excellent memory. These people are inclined to use their intellect at the expense of their emotions. They may also tend to look down on people who are not their intellectual equals. Apart from this they are well balanced and enjoy helping others. Home and family are important to them.\n\nEmotional Balance\nPeople with this arrow in their charts are understanding, compassionate and emotionally well-balanced. They can easily understand and empathize with other people\'s points of view. They are also natural healers. This is an extremely strong arrow because of the presence of 5. When people with arrow decide to do something they don\'t stop halfway. They achieve their goals.\n\nPracticality\nPeople with this arrow in their charts are capable with their hands. This may simply mean they work hard, but they can also express as form of creativity. These people are usally the "salt of the earth," being down to earth, capable, practical and easy to get along with.This arrow usually relates to physical talents, but it can also be related to mental dexterity as well. These people are prepared to work long and hard for anything that they believe in.\n\nPlanner\nPeople with this combination have at least one number in each of the Mental, Emotional and Practical Planes. They are well-organized people who enjoy planning ahead and achieving their goals. Their weakness is in being undisciplined with the details. These people express themselves well and enjoy lengthy discussions on subjects that interest them. They can also be studious and completely immerse themselves in their studies, be coming oblivious to everything around them.\n\nWillpower\nPeople with this arrow in their charts are inclined to be self-centered, dynamic and unbelievably persistent. They tend to be unaware of the feelings of others and can unwittingly hurt others in their drive to reach their own goals. However, they make extremely good friends. Once someone with this arrow becomes your friend, nothing will break the friendship. These people often experience major problems in their lives, but remain positive and optimistic. Invariably, they find resolutions.\n\nActivity\nPeople with this arrow in their charts need to express themselves through action. They need to be busy, either physically or mentally. They dislike confined spaces and prefer being outdoors with plenty of room around them. They have a tendency to be nervous and express themselves well with words on paper.\n\nIndecision\nPeople with an arrow of indecision will be likeable, caring people who want to do the right thing. Consequently, they will find it difficult to make decisions where it is impossible to please everybody.\n\nSkepticism\nPeople with this combination in their charts like to see things demonstrated or proven, rather than accepting things on trust. They usually have a conservative approach to religion and are likely to simply accept the beliefs of their parents without questioning them in any way. These people are loving, honest and fair, but frequently find it difficult to express these feelings to others. They are idealists and have strong visionary capabilities that can make them highly intuitive.\n\nPoor Memory\nThe absence of the mental numbers does not indicate a low intellect. In fact, the opposite is frequently the case and many people with this combination have been very quick and witty. What it means is that the mental faculties tend to fade as the person gets older. This comes out as forgetfulness and absentmindedness. People with this arrow usually learn slowly as children, but catch up later on. Then, in later life, their intellect gradually deserts them. This can be averted if they keep themselves mentally alert and stimulated with a variety of hobbies and interests.\n\nEmotional Sensitivity\nPeople with this arrow in their charts are overly sensitive and easily hurt. They soon learn how to hide their feelings. These people are also very capable of supporting and nurturing others, particularly those who deserve their help. People with this arrow are usually shy as children, though most overcome this as they mature. Some, unfortunately, have an inferiority complex that lasts through their lifetime.\n\nImpracticality\nThese people have no numbers in the Practical Plane, so they will lead their lives mainly in a world of logic and emotion. They will be impractical, idealistic and find it hard to function in everyday life. However, these people will excel in theoretical, rather than practical, pursuits.\n\nFrustrations\nPeople with this arrow experience more than their fair share of setbacks, disappointments and frustrations. This is usually their own fault as they expect more from others than they should. Until they learn to accept other people as they are, they are doomed to continual frustration and disillusionment.\n\nHesitation\nPeople with this arrow lack motivation, are disorganized in their thinking and fail to make plans. Because of this, they seldom achieve much until they learn self-discipline and set some worthwhile goals for themselves. Once they do this, they can then become pioneers and innovators.

They achieve most when in partnership with someone who provides frequent encouragement and prompts them into action. \n\n31\nPeople born on the 31st of the month possess goc : business, organizational and managerial skills.
